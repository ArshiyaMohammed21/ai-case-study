# Overview and Origin

This case study will focus on Tempus, Inc., a medical technology company that uses AI to advance precision medicine. Founded in 2015 by Eric Lefkofsky, who is also known for co-founding Groupon, Tempus aims to revolutionize cancer care through AI. Lefkofsky received his degrees from the University of Michigan, including a law degree. 

Eric Lefkofsky was inspired to start Tempus after his wife’s breast cancer diagnosis in 2014. His goal was to create a platform that would allow AI to improve cancer care and precision medicine. Tempus has raised over $1.3 billion from investors such as Revolution Growth, New Enterprise Associates, and Baillie Gifford.

A quote from Lefkofsky:
> "Businesses are best when there is some personal motivation, when you are trying to solve a problem that is personal to you."

## Business Activities

Tempus addresses the challenge of selecting optimal treatments due to insufficient genetic information. By collecting and analyzing patients' genetic data, Tempus enhances the personalization of healthcare. Their platform supports doctors, hospitals, and healthcare providers by providing critical data for more effective treatment decisions.

Tempus stands out by integrating clinical and molecular data, offering a deep and broad understanding of patients. They utilize cutting-edge technologies including:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning**: For analyzing complex data and identifying treatment patterns.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To extract and summarize important information from patient reports.
- **Genomic Sequencing**: To analyze DNA and identify genetic mutations that influence treatment decisions.

### Landscape

Tempus operates in the healthcare technology and precision medicine sectors, which have experienced significant growth, particularly with advances in big data and AI. The healthcare industry has increasingly adopted AI for predicting patient outcomes and optimizing treatment plans. Other notable companies in this field include:

- Foundation Medicine
- Illumina
- Flatiron Health
- Grail
- IBM Watson Health

#### Results

Tempus has made a substantial impact on the industry, particularly in precision medicine. They have developed one of the largest digital libraries of molecular and clinical data, improving their data infrastructure and forming numerous partnerships with major healthcare providers.

Key success metrics in this field include:
- **Patient Outcomes**: Improvements in survival rates and treatment effectiveness.
- **Adoption Rate**: The extent to which hospitals and healthcare providers use Tempus's platform.

Tempus excels in these areas, contributing to better patient outcomes through personalized treatment plans and achieving high adoption rates among healthcare providers.

##### Recommendations

To further enhance its impact, Tempus could develop methods for early cancer detection. By expanding their services to include genetic testing for early cancer risk assessment, Tempus could improve early diagnosis and prevention.

Technologies required for this include:
- **Advanced Genomic Sequencing**: To identify early cancer biomarkers.
- **AI Methods**: To detect patterns indicative of early-stage cancer using blood samples.

Expanding into early cancer detection would strengthen Tempus’s market position and drive further advancements in medicine and healthcare technology.
